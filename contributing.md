# Contributing to Project
**All** are welcome to contribute to our efforts to combat gerrymandering. If making a PR for a certain issue, please reference issue number.

## General Guidelines
- All PR's should ideally be unit tested.
- All code should be run through linter (StandardJS)
- For code that makes significantly large changes to application, PR should be reviewed by two or more individuals.
- Otherwise, most PR's can be adequately reviewed by one individual. (Anyone is free to comment on a PR they feel deserves multiple reviewers)
- PR's should ideally be reviewed and/or merged within 1-3 days of request, and no later than a week.
- Don't hesitate to reach out to other members of the project for any issues/questions concerning your PR
